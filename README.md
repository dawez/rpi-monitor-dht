rpi-monitor-dht
===============

The files needed to extend RPi-Monitor and show a DHT sensor data.

## Introduction ##

[RPi-Monitor](http://rpi-experiences.blogspot.com.br/p/rpi-monitor.html) is a nice monitoring tool for your Raspberry Pi. It provides a web view where you can watch things such as memory, CPU and temperature. It also can be easily extended to show the temperature and humidity read by a DHT sensor.

## Dependencies ##

- [Python](https://www.python.org) 2.6 or greater
- [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org) 1.2.2 or greater
- [Adafruit DHT library](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/software-install-updated)
- [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org)

## Configuration ##

- Copy [dht.conf](dht.conf) to `/etc/rpimonitor/template/`
- Add the following line to `/etc/rpimonitor/data.conf`
```
include=/etc/rpimonitor/template/dht.conf
```
- Copy [dht.png](dht.png) to `/usr/share/rpimonitor/web/img`
- Copy [__dht.conf](__dht.conf) to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/dht.conf`
- Modify `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/dht.conf` with your sensor model (11, 22 or 2302) and RPi pin
- Run `sudo groupadd supervisor;sudo usermod -a -G supervisor pi`
- Modify `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` with the following:
```
[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor.sock
chmod=0770
chown=root:supervisor
```
- Run `sudo mkdir /usr/local/sbin/rpimonitor/`
- Copy [dht.py](dht.py) to `/usr/local/sbin/rpimonitor`  
- Logout/login and run `sudo service supervisor restart;sudo service rpimonitor restart`
